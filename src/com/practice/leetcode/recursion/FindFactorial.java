 * 
 * Time Complexity
 * 
 * For factorial(n), the function calls factorial(n-1), then factorial(n-2), â€¦
 * until factorial(1).
 * 
 * So the number of recursive calls = n.
 * 
 * Each call just does O(1) work (multiplication + function overhead).
 * 
 * Time Complexity = O(n)
 * 
 * Space Complexity
 * 
 * The recursion goes as deep as n calls before returning.
 * 
 * Each recursive call is stored in the function call stack.
 * 
 * So, maximum stack depth = n.
 * 
 * Space Complexity = O(n)
 * 
 * Final Answer:
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
